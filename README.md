## Elevator Pitch
Since the dawn of the internet, as a society we have never been more connected. However, on a more micro scale, we have never been so disconnected. We try to use social media to stay in touch with friends and family, but social media has started to push influencers over people you have a connection with. 

What we need isn't another form of social media. We need a simple website which helps us to hang out with friends and get away from our devices. What I am proposing is a website called **QuickConnect**. On this site, friends can go on at any time and update their availability for a given day . This is in the form of a familiar calendar. Friends can block out when they are free or are totally unavailable. Finding a time to hang out will never be easier.

Instead of relying on socail media to connect to our friends and family, **QuickConnect** can help us to stengthen our precious relationships.

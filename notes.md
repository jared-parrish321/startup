##What I Learned From GitHub
1. VS Code makes dealing with merge conflicts easy
2. GitHub is one of those things where it slows you down a little during coding but you ultimately save a ton of time 
3. Git is only helpful if you use it. Commit often and include informative commit messages to make your life easier
